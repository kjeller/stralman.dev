## Backstory

This year a friend of mine got me into analog cameras. I won't go into much detail but it was during
a bachelor party,
I was under the influence of alcohol and open to vacation activity ideas.. all of which led to me
being ever so slightly more susceptible to
the thought of having a new hobby.

Now I am not really a "camera guy" but I though "Hey let's give it a shot. It might be fun."...
I am now an owner of four analog cameras, all of which are from before I was even born.
Older cameras tends to not always operate and on a whim they can be inoperatable.

**The problem**

One of my cameras, the Olympus OM-10, can not trigger its shutter mechanism correctly when pressing
the shutter button.
When the shutter button is depressed and then released, the film lever is stuck and the film can not
advance which also affects
the shutter button since it no longer can be depressed (very sad).

Sidenote: Now ignore that I bought this broken camera way before the previously mentioned bachelor
party and
that it was as inoperatable then as now.

**The solution**

By opening the bottom cover of the camera and exposing the beautiful mechanical insides, I could
trial-and-error
my way into triggering the shutter "retraction" mechanism by hand. This enabled the film lever to
work thus making the
shutter button available again! The trigger kick could not reach the retraction lever for the film
advance lever resulting
in a state where nothing neither the shutter button nor the film advance lever could function
without manual intervening (my finger).

Here's a video in slow motion showing the shutter button trigger mechanism:

By bending the "trigger kicker" inwards I allowed it to reach the retraction lever and the camera
functions once again!
